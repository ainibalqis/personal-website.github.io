<p style="text-align: justify;">Hailing from a middle class family, I am Aini Balqis binti Abbas. I am 20 years old. I am currently studying in UiTM Kedah. 
I feel glad to be the part of this great university with the such great friends, helpful and loving lecturers and the sound university administration.No one comes in this world at the stage where I am right now, without the support of family and friends. 
In fact, what I am today, is because of my family.
My father is a successful and hardworking fisherman. My mothers is a pretty and talented housewife. They both love their profession. That’s I have learned from my parents. That is,  the value of time, sincerity, hard work and dedication to the purpose.
I have six siblings and I am the third child in my family. I have one brother, one sister and three younger brothers. Besides my brother and sister, I am in charge to guide and take care of my other siblings. 
We all have grown up and my three younger are still studying in primary and secondary schools.
Music is my passion. I really love to listen music in whatever I do. I have a keen interest in listening different types and genre of music.
Though I am rarely free from my routine works. But whenever I am free I love to watch a few movies and Korean drama.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Friends are the best mirrors of a person. In fact, the circle of friends you chose to stay with, does define your personality and priorities. I am fortunate enough to have the best ever friends in my life.
I have three best friends. Not only they are my best friend but they are my class fellow as well. They are, in fact, a kind, gentle and sincere individual.
I love time management and discipline in life. I have learned all of these value from my parents. My parents are my true inspiration.
They has groomed me like themselves. I am quite inspired by them and that has been the single aim of my life to serve the people selflessly, as my parents does.
Time is quite a precious commodity. One should exercise minimum care in utilizing one’s time. I have learned throughout all the years of my life, the good value of time and discipline. 
I love having the time management, sound strategy and clear cut goals in the life.
My life is full of experiments and achievements. I have got success many times and many times I have failed also. This all has truly taught me the importance of rising again and strike again. 
I continue to update myself to be the better version of myself. 
Although no one can be described in a few set of sentences. One need to have though command of oneself before going to write something about their life.
That’s to say my life has become what is,  an essence of all of my achievements and struggles.</p>
